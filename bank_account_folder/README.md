Assignment: Bank Account
As we continue thinking about our banking application, we realize that it would be more accurate to assign a balance not to the user directly, but that in the real world, users have accounts, and accounts have balances. This gives us the idea that maybe an account is its own class! But as we stated, it is not completely independent of a class; accounts only exist because users open them.

For this assignment, don't worry about putting any user information in the BankAccount class. We'll take care of that in the next lesson!

Let's first just get some more practice writing classes by writing a new BankAccount class.

The BankAccount class should have a balance. When a new BankAccount instance is created, if an amount is given, the balance of the account should initially be set to that amount; otherwise, the balance should start at $0. The account should also have an interest rate in decimal format. For example, a 1% interest rate would be saved as 0.01. The interest rate should be provided upon instantiation. (Hint: when using default values in parameters, the order of parameters matters!)
The class should also have the following methods:

deposit(self, amount) - increases the account balance by the given amount
withdraw(self, amount) - decreases the account balance by the given amount if there are sufficient funds; if there is not enough money, print a message "Insufficient funds: Charging a $5 fee" and deduct $5
display_account_info(self) - print to the console: eg. "Balance: $100"
yield_interest(self) - increases the account balance by the current balance * the interest rate (as long as the balance is positive)



Assignment: Users with Bank Accounts
Update your existing User class to have an association with the BankAccount class. You should not have to change anything in the BankAccount class. The method signatures of the User class (the first line of the method with the def keyword) should also remain the same.
But our User class no longer has a self.account_balance attribute. Instead, we have replaced this with an instance of a BankAccount by the name of self.account. That means our make_deposit (and other methods referencing self.account_balance) need to be updated! That's the goal of this assignment.
